## Introduction

As I grew older, I noticed that work, school, and life in general became more demanding; to build the future that I envisioned for myself, I needed to work harder and harder to start my career off on the right foot. However, grinding came at the cost of my personal relationships; the more I worked, the more I pushed others aside, and the more depressed I became.

I knew I needed to find a better balance between work and my personal life. On top of that, with how competitive the CS field is, I also needed a way to stand out. So, I decided to create a project that could help me tackle both of these challenges.

My idea was simple: create a social app that helps maintain relationships. The basic concept was that users could create a profile, add their friends, and set up reminders to check in on them. This way, I could stay connected with friends and family without worrying about forgetting.

At first glance, it seemed pretty basic, so I thought, why not leverage the power of LLMs to create more personalized and advanced plans tailored to the specific person Iâ€™m hanging out with? After all, everyone is different, with unique preferences and interests, so it made sense to make the experience more customized.
